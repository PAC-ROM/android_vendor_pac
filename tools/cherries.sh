#Preamble: Some repos outside of PAC may have commits we need that take too
#  long to be merged. Adding these cherry-picks here can automate the process
#  and makes it possible to add them to the weeklies but not the nightlies.
#  currently supported gerrit accounts are:
#    AOKP - Android Open Kang Project
#    AOSP - Android Open Source Project
#    CM   - CyanogenMod
#    PAC  - pac-rom
#    PA   - Paranoid Android (AOSPA)
#
#  in addition, cherry-pick patch files can be created for commits that aren't
#  available in the above gerrit accounts.
#
# PATCH CAPABILITY BY SHUMASH 2014-07-22
# ONLINE OPTION BY LUKASZ 2014-07-27
# case $device in
#  <device_name>)
#    add cherry-pick patches for non-gerrit commits like this:
#      PATCH=<name of patch without extension>
#      FOLDER=<name of folder in build tree where patch is to be applied>
#      patch_it  # this function call is required for each patch file
#        |
#      <Repeat for each separate patch>
#
#    For gerrit commits, add the cherry-pick(s) in the form:
#      cherries +=(GERRIT-COMMIT#_GERRIT-ACCOUNT)
#     e.g. http://review.pac-rom.com/#/c/250/2/tools/cherries.sh would be cherries+=(250_PAC)
#        |
#      <Repeat for each separate cherry-pick>
#
#    For gerrit topics, add the topics(s) in the form:
#      cherries +=(TOPIC_GERRIT-ACCOUNT)
#     e.g. http://review.pac-rom.com/#/q/topic:CREncoder would be topics+=(CREncoder_PAC)
#        |
#      <Repeat for each separate topic>
#
#   ;;
#  On-line patches can be called by specifying a URL as the PATCH variable and calling the
#  patch_it function with the parameter 'true', i.e., patch_it true
#
#  Any patches stored in the vendor/pac/tool/patches folder must have a .patch extension
#  with a prefix name that exactly matches the PATCH name.  See below for examples.
#  All patches must be in the git format-patch email format for use by git am
#  Create a patch for the latest or last n patches with this command
#     git format-patch -n (-1 for the last commit, -3 for the last three, etc.)
#  Go here for a good description of how to create patches:
#  http://docs.moodle.org/dev/How_to_create_a_patch
#  Additionally, you can create a patch file from a github commit by going into the URL address
#  line in your browser and adding ".patch" at the end.  It will immediately be downloaded as
#  patch file.
